# Password_Generator

As we live in this complex world of websites and softwares on the internet, severeal times we come across situations where we have to create an account. Whenever we create an account, having a strong password is must, for otherwise our account and the sensitive info associated with it gets easily accesssed by hackers. Hackers are quite active on the internet trying to attack any less careful victim.

So in such a condition, using weak or common passwords like PASSWORD123 is quite dangerous. But who is going to come up with a variety of strong passwords for all our accounts? Well, its time to use your custom password genearator, who generates a strong and powerful password based on the details you provide it.

Currently this application is quite mudane but it shall surely be improved in future with more features and interesting elements.

Also, I am currently working on a wordlist generator, which would help ethical hackers generate a long list of possible passwords based on the info provided. It shall be more convenient than most worlists as it shall be generated by the info provided by you, unlike usual wordlists that have random words as passwords, which might have a less chance of being the password of the victim. You may know the likes and dislikes of the victim and you can use those words as keywords to generate a more probable wordlist.
