# Password_Generator

Password Generator generates passwords for you based on the provided details
The Wordlist Generator generates a list of passwords, called a wordlist

## **Warning(Now no more)**
There was a commented section in the Wordlist_Generator.py file which has been now been removed in the latest version for safety reasons. It generated a huge list of passwords, that would fill your storage capacity, and completely destroy your system or server. Just for information, if you used that section of code to generate all possible 8 character passwords, it shall create a txt file conataining all the passwords, and the **size of that file would be 3600 TB !!**

So now you can instead use the current program to provide a list of characters and generate a wordlist based on those set of characters only
